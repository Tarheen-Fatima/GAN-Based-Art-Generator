# GAN-Based Art Generator: Mood-Driven Image Creation

This project uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate images from the MNIST dataset. The unique feature of this GAN is that the art generated can be adjusted based on user moods, producing outputs that reflect different emotional states such as "calm," "chaos," or "neutral."

## Project Overview

The model consists of two main components:

1. **Generator**: Generates fake images from random noise.
2. **Discriminator**: Classifies images as real or fake.

These two models are trained together in an adversarial manner to improve both the generator's ability to create realistic images and the discriminator's ability to distinguish between real and fake images.

Additionally, the generator creates different styles of art based on the user's selected mood. 

### Moods:
- **Calm**: Generates smoother, more subtle images by adjusting the noise distribution.
- **Chaos**: Produces more chaotic, abstract images with a higher variance in noise.
- **Neutral**: Generates default, balanced images.

## Model Architecture

### Generator
- Fully connected layer followed by reshaping into (7, 7, 128) dimensions.
- Two Conv2DTranspose layers to upsample the image size.
- Final Conv2D layer with `tanh` activation to produce a 28x28 grayscale image.

### Discriminator
- Convolutional layers followed by LeakyReLU activations.
- Flattening and Dense layers with a sigmoid output to classify the images.

## Training the GAN

The GAN is trained using the MNIST dataset. The training function iteratively trains the discriminator on both real and fake images and trains the generator through the combined GAN model.

Training involves:
- **Discriminator**: Trained on real images from the MNIST dataset and fake images generated by the generator.
- **Generator**: Trained via the GAN to improve its image generation by "fooling" the discriminator.


## Mood-Based Art Generation

The script includes a unique feature that allows users to generate art based on their mood. The generator creates images using random noise, and the variance of the noise is adjusted according to the mood selected by the user.

### Moods:
- **Calm**: Uses low-variance noise to generate smoother, more relaxed images.
- **Chaos**: Uses high-variance noise to generate more abstract, chaotic images.
- **Neutral**: Default variance to generate balanced images.

## Customization

- **Adjusting mood noise**: You can fine-tune the variance of the noise for each mood inside the `generate_art()` function to produce different effects.
- **Model architecture**: Feel free to adjust the architecture by adding/removing layers in the generator or discriminator to experiment with different results.
